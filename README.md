[View the live project here](https://the-smoking-goat.herokuapp.com/)

The Smoking Goat is a website for a restaurant that allows bookings to be made by registered users. It also allows users access to recipes created by the chef. The website allows staff to update the menu, add or remove items. Staff members can also  edit, delete or create new recipes on the site without accessing the admin panel. The staff also has access to a list of bookings for a given day and can add, edit or delete days that the restaurant is not open ex. Christmas day. The booking system only takes 5 bookings per time slot for up to 6 people per booking. If the time is fully booked the time will not be available when making a booking.

    - As this project uses Django templates the html has been validated by manually clicking through the application pages, copying the source of the rendered pages and then validating this version of the html using the W3C Validator (link shown above).

    - Results: All pages passed without errors except the Recipe detail page. An error was indicated for use of % in width attribute in image tag, expected a number.
  

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

  - Results: No errors were found in style.css

### Automated Testing

   - [Django testing tools](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/tools/) were used to test the application python code.  
   - DB tests were run in the development environment against a local SQLite3 database. 
   - Tests were written for the following files :

      - Booking tests for [views.py](booking/views.py):  test file: [test_views.py](booking/test_views.py)
      - Easy Recipe tests for [views.py](easy_recipe/views.py): test file: [test_views.py](easy_recipe/test_views.py)
      - Menu tests for [views.py](menu/views.py):  test file: [test_views.py](menu/test_views.py)
      - Home tests for [views.py](home/views.py): test file: [test_views.py](home/test_views.py)

  - Django test results and coverage :

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome DevTools was used to test the responsiveness of the application on different screen sizes.
 
    
### Manual Testing Test Cases and Results

- The application was tested for both site users and staff users. Recipes was added, updated and deleted. Menu add items, edit and delete items was tested. Booking was tested for two users booking at the same time for the same time slot. The reset password was tested with the email confirmation. Adding, deleting and editing closed days was tested. Customer booking and deleting was tested. All links and navigation links were tested.

### Known bugs

- Currently no known bugs.

## Deployment

### How to Clone the Repository 

- Go to the https://github.com/louwJohan/project4-ci repository on GitHub 
- Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
- Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
- On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process
- To install the packages required by the application use the command : pip install -r requirements.txt
- When developing and running the application locally set DEBUG=True in the settings.py file
- Changes made to the local clone can be pushed back to the repository using the following commands :

  - git add *filenames*  (or "." to add all changed files)
  - git commit -m *"text message describing changes"*
  - git push

- N.B. Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project once the application is re-deployed from Heroku

### Create Application and Postgres DB on Heroku
- Log in to Heroku at https://heroku.com - create an account if needed.
- From the Heroku dashboard, click the Create new app button.  For a new account an icon will be visible on screen to allow you to Create an app, otherwise a link to this function is located under the New dropdown menu at the top right of the screen.
- On the Create New App page, enter a unique name for the application and select region.  Then click Create app.
- On the Application Configuration page for the new app, click on the Resources tab.
- In the Add-ons search bar enter "Postgres" and select "Heroku Postgres" from the list - click the "Submit Order Form" button on the pop-up dialog.
- Next, click on Settings on the Application Configuration page and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button - check the DATABASE_URL has been automatically set up. 
- Add a new Config Var called DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and assign it a value of 1.
- Add a new Config Var called SECRET_KEY and assign it a value - any random string of letters, digits and symbols.
- The settings.py file should be updated to use the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY environment variable values as follows :

  - DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}

  - SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

- In Gitpod, in the project terminal window, to initialize the data model in the postgres database, run the command : python3 manage.py migrate 
- Make sure the project requirements.txt file is up to date with all necessary supporting files by entering the command : pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Commit and push any local changes to GitHub.
- In order to be able to run the application on localhost, add SECRECT_KEY and DATABASE_URL and their values to env.py

### Configure Cloudinary to host images used by the application
- Log in to Cloudinary - create an account if needed.  To create the account provide your name, email and set up a password.  For "primary interest" you can choose "Programmable Media for image and video API".  Click "Create Account" and you will be sent an email to verify your account and bring you to the dashboard.
- From the dashboard, copy the "API Environment variable" value by clicking on the "Copy to clipboard" link.
- Log in to Heroku and go to the Application Configuration page for the application.  Click on Settings and click on the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
- Add a new Config Var called CLOUDINARY_URL and assign it the value copied from the Cloudinary dashboard, but remove the "CLOUDINARY_URL=" at the beginning of the string. 
- In order to be able to run the application on localhost, also add the CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable and value to env.py

### Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository
- Go to the Application Configuration page for the application on Heroku and click on the Deploy tab.
- Select GitHub as the Deployment Method and if prompted, confirm that you want to connect to GitHub. Enter the name of the github repository (the one used for this project is (https://github.com/louwJohan/project4-ci) and click on Connect to link up the Heroku app to the GitHub repository code.
- Scroll down the page and choose to either Automatically Deploy each time changes are pushed to GitHub, or Manually deploy - for this project Manual Deploy was selected.
- The application can be run from the Application Configuration page by clicking on the Open App button.
- The live link for this project is (https://the-smoking-goat.herokuapp.com/)

### Final Deployment steps
Once code changes have been completed and tested on localhost, the application can be prepared for Heroku deployment as follows :
- Set DEBUG flag to False in settings.py
- Ensure requirements.txt is up to date using the command : pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- Push files to GitHub
- In the Heroku Config Vars for the application delete this environment variable :  DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
- On the Heroku dashboard go to the Deploy tab for the application and click on deploy branch
